# EarthQuake Simulator

- Visualized real-world geographical data on a 3D textured globe.
- Applied textures to 3D objects.
- Algorithmically create a deforming 3D mesh and display it using vertex buffers.
- Defined normal vectors and texture coordinates for a sphere.
- Converted from spherical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to 3D Cartesian coordinates.
